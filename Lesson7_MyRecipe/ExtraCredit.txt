I chose CornBread to do my recipe for Lesson 7. For my DOM traversal I stuck with the next() method because it fits easier within my design. As for the CSS change within this design, I decided to change the backgroud color to brown behind the ingredients and the instructions header. Lastly, for the animation/event, I chose the fadeTo method with a duration of 5000 miliseconds and .2 as the opacity. I like how you have to stay hovered on the section you prefer to keep it on the page.
